> Whitespace outside of and between name, operator and value is ignored
language:eno
  language  :  eno  
  
> As you see above, multiple fields with the same name are possible,
> whether they are allowed is decided by the application.

> Anything goes after the name operator (:)
This is a sentence: It was a night full of ⭐s and 🤖s in 서울특별시!

> Almost anything goes before the name operator too
It was a night full of ⭐s and 🤖s in 서울특별시!: That was a sentence.

> Some things are not allowed in the name, they need to be escaped
`The : in a name needs to be escaped`: The : in a value is fine

> Here's everything that needs to be escaped in a name, and why:

`1:0`: At the first : the name ends, it always needs to be escaped

A-Z: The - is fine when it's preceded by something else
`-AZ`: The - at the start would start a list item

A # of things : The # is fine if it does not start the name
`# of things`: The # at the start would start a section

Php\Namespace : The \ is fine if it's not the first non-whitespace character
`\Php\Namespace`: The \ at the start would start a line continuation

Left|Right : The | is fine if it's not the first character in the name
`|Right`: The | at the start would start a newline continuation

Greater > Smaller: The > is fine if it's not the first thing in the name
`> Smaller`: The > at the start would start a comment
