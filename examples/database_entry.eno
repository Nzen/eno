We the People of Detroit Community Research Collective (WTP CRC) is a
collaboration between community activists, academics, researchers and designers.
Our research is produced with and for the citizens of Detroit. This research has
been used in a wide range of settings, from community organizing to legal and
legislative work. We hope that our work will be of further use to Detroiters in
their efforts to build a more democratic city.
